=== Seedbox tools ===

Seedbox tools is a software package that automates the process of fetching
finished torrents from your seedbox, and dispatching new torrents on your
seedbox as well.

== Package contents ==

This package contains several tools:
    
    1. leechtorrents: a tool that leeches finished downloads from a torrent
       seedbox to your local computer.
    2. dispatchtorrent: a tool that uploads a torrent file or magnet URL
       to a seedbox, telling the seedbox to start downloading.
    3. seedboxsetup: a configuration wizard to set up the clients to work
       properly against your seedbox.

== Requirements ==
    
    - Python 2.7 on your local machine
    - an SSH server on your seedbox, and a user account there
    - an SSH client on your local machine
    - rsync on both machines

== Installation ==

You will need to install this package on your local machine.

If you are on an RPM-based distribution, build an RPM from the source package
and install the resulting RPM:
    
    python setup.py bdist_rpm

Otherwise, just use the standard Python installation system:

    python setup.py install

You can also run it directly from the unpacked source directory:
    
    export PYTHONPATH=src
    bin/leechtorrents --help

== Configuration ==

Both tools require some configuration after installation.  There is a nifty
configuration wizard that will set the configuration file up.  Run it and
answer a few questions:
    
    seedboxsetup
